3. A summary of what you have used to enhance with bootstrap compared to your HW2 version:

I used a Bootstrap template:
https://themewagon.com/themes/free-bootstrap-4-html5-portfolio-website-template-dominic/

* I used this template to carry out the layout and the style of the page.
* I removed some of the sections that I did not intend to use: testimonials.
* I renamed some of the sections to match my content. For example, the section
"Services" of the original template was renamed to "Work".
* I changed the styling of some sections. For example, I added a ul block for
my Work section to list my responsibilities.
* In Portfolio Section I added a new separate tab for each hw assignment. Also, in this section,
instead of viewing the image when clicking it I added a button with the link to open the assignment on a
different page.
* In Blog section I removed some unnecessary for me features, like comments and the date information
on top of the image. Also, I added my text content and styled it as it was before.
* For each link in nav bar on top and on bottom I changed where it links to.

The main difference is that now my page has a nav bar to easily find the contents of the page and
also it is responsive to any device size.
